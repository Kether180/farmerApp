   User registration, login, and authentication.
   User profile management (updating contact information, preferences).
   Role-based access control, if you have different user roles (e.g., farmers, customers, administrators).
   Relevance: Essential for personalized user experience, security, and maintaining user data.
   
2. CropManagement (or ProductManagement)
   Purpose: Manages the products, which in this case are organic foods and items offered by farmers.
   Functions:
   Cataloging products (adding, updating, removing items).
   Managing product details like descriptions, pricing, organic certification, farmer information.
   Inventory management, if applicable.
   Relevance: Central to your app's core offering, ensuring users have access to up-to-date and accurate product information.

3. OfferManagement (Alternative to CropManagement)
   Purpose: Specifically handles the offers posted by farmers.
   Functions:
   Posting new offers, updating existing ones, and removing old offers.
   Managing details of offers like special pricing, availability periods, descriptions.
   Relevance: Directly related to the main functionality of your app, crucial for presenting the right offers to users.

4. OrderProcessing
   Purpose: Manages the process of users placing orders for products or offers.
   Functions:
   Handling order placements, order history, and tracking.
   Managing payment transactions and order fulfillment.

   Additional Considerations:
   Location and Language Modules: Since your app targets the Danish market, modules handling localization, language preferences, and region-specific features might be relevant.
   Farmer Management: If farmers have the ability to manage their profiles, products, and offers, a dedicated module for farmer accounts and their dashboard could be beneficial.
   Analytics and Reporting: To track the usage of your app, user preferences, popular products, etc., for business insights.
